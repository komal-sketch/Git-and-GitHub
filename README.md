This README introduces basic Git operations, the state of files within a Git repository, the rationale for branching strategies, and it compares popular Git hosting services. It also shows how to inspect the `.git/hooks` directory for hook samples and how to install tools such as `flake8` for Python code linting.

                                                                # Git & GitHub basics
It documents how to initialise a repository, stage and commit changes, configure your identity, work with remotes and branches, and how to explore the hidden .git folder. It also includes comparison tables for Git, GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket, as well as a short table contrasting a normal file system with a version control system (VCS).   

                                                               # Formatted Git commands

| Command or topic                                                                                   | Purpose / explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This creates a `.git` folder where Git stores the history and hooks.                                                                                         |

Use `git add .` to stage all modified files.                                                                                                          |

Use meaningful messages rather than file names.                                                                                                                  |
| `git config --global user.email "awsuser@gmail.com"` and `git config --global user.name "awsuser"` | Configure your Git identity so commits are attributed correctly.                                                                                                                                                        |

Useful for untracking accidentally committed files.                                                                            |

Use feature branches for isolated work.                                                                                                                 |

| **Untracked → Staged → Tracked**                                                                   | Files start as **untracked** when not in the repository.  Running `git add` stages them (they become **staged**).  After committing they are **tracked** and Git monitors subsequent changes.                           |
| **Branching strategy / feature branches**                                                          | Use branches to isolate work; a **feature branch** is created off `main` for a new feature or bug fix.  Keep branches short‑lived and merge back via pull requests.  `HEAD` is the pointer to your current branch tip.  |
| `cd .git`, `cd hooks/` & `ls`                                                                      | Navigate into the hidden `.git` folder to inspect internal files.  The `hooks` directory contains sample hook scripts (with `.sample` suffix).  To enable a hook remove the `.sample` extension and make it executable. |
| `pip install flake8` and `chmod +x pre-commit`                                                     | Install the **flake8** Python linter.  The `pre-commit` hook (see *scripts* folder) runs `flake8` and secrets checks before allowing a commit.  You must make the hook executable using `chmod +x`.                     |


 # Additional notes:

•	**Removing cached files** : git rm --cached file-name stops tracking a file without deleting it locally. This is useful for removing secrets or large files from version control.

•	**File states** : A file can be untracked (Git doesn’t know about it), modified/staged (changes recorded in the index) or committed (stored in the repository history).

•	**Branching strategies** : Common strategies include Git Flow (feature, develop, release, hotfix branches) and trunk based development. Choose a strategy that suits your team’s deployment cadence.

•	**HEAD pointer** : HEAD refers to the current commit; changing branches moves HEAD to a different ref.

•	**Hooks directory** : By default the .git/hooks directory contains several .sample files like pre-commit.sample, commit-msg.sample, etc. Copy or rename these to remove the .sample suffix to activate them.

 # File system vs version control system (VCS):

 | Scenario / feature           | File system                                                                                                  | Version control system                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial state (Day 1)**    | Stores files with basic metadata (author, size, type).                                                       | Stores files with the same metadata as the file system.                                                 |
| **Changes (Day 2)**          | Overwrites files when modified; only the latest state is retained.                                           | Saves each change as a new version; developers can review exactly what changed.                         |
| **Concurrent edits (Day 3)** | If multiple people modify a file, you only see the last modification and cannot tell who made earlier edits. | Maintains a history of all changes by all contributors; you can see which team member made each change. |
| **Revert / audit**           | Difficult to revert to previous versions; may require manual backups.                                        | Easy to revert to any prior state and to compare versions; traceability of every change.                |
| **Collaboration**            | No built‑in mechanism to merge concurrent changes; manual coordination required.                             | Branching and merging allow multiple developers to work independently and combine their work safely.    |
