## Overview

When working with Git, it’s common to encounter errors while pulling changes from a remote repository, especially when your local branch has diverged from the remote branch.

One such error is:

```bash
git pull origin master

Output:
From https://github.com/komal-sketch/Git-and-GitHub
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

Why This Error Occurs?

This happens when your local branch and the remote branch have different commits that the other doesn’t have — in other words, the branches have diverged.

Git cannot automatically decide whether to merge, rebase, or fast-forward the changes, so it stops and asks for guidance.

Steps to Resolve the Error:
Step 1: Decide How to Reconcile

You have three options:

Merge (default, safe):

                       git pull origin master --no-rebase

Rebase (linear history):

                       git pull origin master --rebase

Fast-forward only (only works if your branch is behind, no divergence):

                                                                        git pull origin master --ff-only


⚠️ Important: Merge is safer for beginners. Rebase keeps history cleaner but requires careful conflict resolution.

Step 2: Pull Changes with Merge:

                                  git pull origin master --no-rebase


Output:

Auto-merging COMMANDS.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in COMMANDS.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.


Git detected a merge conflict in COMMANDS.md because both local and remote branches modified the same part of the file.

Step 3: Resolve Merge Conflicts

 1. Open the conflicting file:

                                nano COMMANDS.md
                                # OR
                                code COMMANDS.md

 2. Look for conflict markers:

                               <<<<<<< HEAD
                                 Your local changes
                                  =======
                                 Remote changes
                                 >>>>>>> origin/master

 3. Edit the file to keep the correct content and remove all conflict markers.


Step 4: Stage the Resolved File:

                                 git add COMMANDS.md

Step 5: Complete the Merge:
                         
                                git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in COMMANDS.md"

Step 6: Push Changes to Remote:
             
                                git push origin master

✅ Your local branch is now in sync with the remote branch, and the conflict is resolved.

Best Practices
•	Regularly pull remote changes to avoid diverging branches.
•	Prefer feature branches for development; avoid committing directly to master.
•	Use merge for simplicity or rebase for a clean history.
•	Always resolve conflicts carefully, reviewing changes from both local and remote.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches` | Local and remote branches have diverged          | Use `git pull origin master --no-rebase` (merge) or `--rebase` (rebase) |
| Merge conflict (e.g., in `COMMANDS.md`)                      | Same lines modified in local and remote branches | Resolve conflicts manually, stage the file, commit, and push            |
